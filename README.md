# Basal ganglia bottleneck paper: neuron counting and simulations
MATLAB code for the "computational bottleneck of basal ganglia output" paper:
1. Counting target neurons of the SNr using Allen Mouse Brain Projection Atlas data.
2. Example simulations of the basal ganglia's control of a cortical RNN and a superior colliculus grid model.

The folder 'Counting SNr target neurons' contains the following data sourced elsewhere:
1. XML files of six staining experiments downloaded from the [Allen Mouse Brain Projection Atlas](https://connectivity.brain-map.org/), published in [Oh et al (2014) Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13186).
2. An Excel file of the 295 non-overlapping brain regions used by [Oh et al (2014) Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13186), derived from their Supplementary Table 1.
3. An Excel file of the Blue Brain Cell Atlas neuron counts, published in [Rodarie et al (2022) PLoS Computational Biology](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010739) and derived from their S2 Excel file.
